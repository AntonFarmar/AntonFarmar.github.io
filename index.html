<p>
    <b>I am a PhD student in mathematics</b> under the supervision of <a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/jay.taylor/">Jay Taylor,</a> currently in my third year of study at the University of Manchester.
    My research involves the representation theory of finite groups in defining characteristic, often involving finite groups of Lie type, and usually involving fields that aren't algebraically closed.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Wondering what all that means?</b> I wrote a <a href="./blog/2025-03-14-what-do-i-do.html">blog post explaining my research</a> at various levels of expertise, from complete layperson to professional researcher.
    Give it a read and let me know what you think!
</p>
<p>
    <b>My undergraduate (master's) degree</b> was also in Manchester, under the supervision of <a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/simon.crawford/">Simon Crawford.</a>
    The thesis was an overview of basic homological algebra and Hilbert's Syzygy theorem.
    I graduated in July 2022.
