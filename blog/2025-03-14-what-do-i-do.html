        <p><a href="../">My name is Anton</a>, and I do research in mathematics.
Here I explain my research interests at three levels: First the
layperson who knows nothing about research mathematics, then the
undergraduate who maybe knows a few fundamental ideas, and then the
researcher who wants to know more of the details.</p>
<h2>For the Layperson</h2>
<p>Mathematicians care a lot about symmetry. Partially because it is
useful, but also simply because it is beautiful. We can use the symmetry
of certain situations – perhaps of a geometric figure, or of something
more abstract – to reduce complicated questions to much simpler
ones.</p>
<p>So how do we study symmetry mathematically? Mathematicians have
devised a kind of mathematical object which describes a collection of
symmetries, which is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">group</a>. The
study of these so-called groups is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory">group theory</a>.
Don't let this unassuming name fool you – these are complex and subtle
objects which form a vast field of study.</p>
<p>A fundamental question mathematicians would like to answer is this:
what are all the possible kinds of symmetry something can have? This is
a bit vague, and since we need to formulate this mathematically in order
to work with it precisely, we instead try to answer this (arguably
identical) question: <em>what are all the possible groups?</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this question seems to be completely impossible to
answer in any satisfying way – groups are just too complicated. Perhaps
this is a surprising fact, since symmetry seems to be so nice.</p>
<p>Since classifying all groups is impossible, mathematicians in the mid
20th century instead began trying to classify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_group">finite simple
groups</a>, which (despite their name) are anything <em>but</em> simple!
These are the groups which are, in a precise sense, the building blocks
of all groups. Although it is difficult to understand how the simple
groups fit together to form other groups, being able to classify all of
them still tells us a lot about groups as a whole.</p>
<p>Fortunately, rather than being impossible, it turned out to be only
<em>nearly</em> impossible to classify the finite simple groups. In the
early 2000s, the herculean effort of classifying the simple groups was
completed, forming what is (in my opinion) the greatest mathematical
achievement of humankind so far.</p>
<p>One of the major ideas used in this enormous project was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory">representation
theory</a>. This is a set of tools that we can use to study finite
groups by interpreting a group as a collection of symmetries of space –
often in dimensions much higher than three – called a representation.
For reasons that still feel mysterious and magical to me, this concept
has turned out to be extremely useful in studying groups, and some of
the most fundamental observations that led to the classification of
finite simple groups are based on representation-theoretic results. A
famous example of the power of representation theory is that
mathematicians had found a way to understand the representations of a
group affectionately called 'the monster' before we even knew that it
existed at all!</p>
<p>In the same way that we try to reduce the problem of classifying all
groups to classifying only the simple groups, we can reduce the problem
of finding all representations of a given group to finding the
<em>irreducible</em> representations – the building blocks of all other
representations. This time, the ways irreducible representations combine
are much less strange than the ways groups combine, and we can often get
a complete classification of representations of a group from a list of
irreducible ones. Finally, a classification that is actually reasonable!
This is one of the ways in which asking questions about representations
leads to convenient results.</p>
<p>My research is about representation theory. I study special groups
that were very important in the classification of finite simple groups –
the groups of Lie type – because if we can answer certain questions
about them, then we can answer questions about the representation theory
of <em>all</em> finite groups. The hope is that this helps us understand
how symmetry works in a deeper way someday.</p>
<h2>For the Undergraduate</h2>
<p>Let's say we have a group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. A
representation of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a function
<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> assigning to each element of
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> invertible matrix with complex
number entries, such that <span class="math inline">\(\rho(gh) =
\rho(g)\rho(h)\)</span>. This on its own is not such an interesting
definition.</p>
<p>We can define a notion of a <em>sum</em> of representations. If we
can choose a basis such that <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>
can always be written as a block diagonal matrix of some smaller
representations <span class="math inline">\(\rho_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_2\)</span> we say that <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is actually the sum <span class="math inline">\(\rho_1 \oplus \rho_2\)</span> of these smaller
representations. A representation that cannot be written as such a sum
is called <em>irreducible.</em> It can be shown that every
representation decomposes as a sum of irreducible representations, or
irreps for short.</p>
<p>Classifying the irreducible representations of a given group is a
common goal when studying representation theory, as one can use a
complete list of them to find out a lot of information about your group
just by looking at the numbers involved. One class of groups whose
representation theory we know a lot about is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_symmetric_group">the
symmetric groups</a>, and there are still a lot of interesting questions
to be resolved about its representations.</p>
<p>Here's a really cool fact. If you have a representation <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and you take the trace of the
matrices, you get what we call a <em>character</em> <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, which is in particular just a function
from <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> into the complex numbers.
Despite ignoring a huge amount of information about the representation,
the character determines a representation completely – up to some
appropriate notion of representations being 'the same' of course. This
means that we can study characters instead of representations a lot of
the time, and this turns out to be very fruitful.</p>
<p>Notice that in the definition I gave, I required the matrices in a
representation to be over the complex numbers. This was a white lie
(forgive me!) as we can actually define representations over any field
we choose. Note that when I say 'field,' I mean a commutative ring with
multiplicative inverses rather than a vector field or similar
object.</p>
<p>A lot of the fundamental results of representation theory depend on
two assumptions about our field:</p>
<ol>
<li>The field we work over is of characteristic zero. That is, <span class="math inline">\(1 + \cdots + 1\)</span> is never equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> in our field. If you're surprised that
this is possible at all, an example of a field that is <em>not</em> like
this is the field of integers modulo a given prime <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</li>
<li>The field we work over is algebraically closed. That is, every
non-constant polynomial has a root in the field. It is difficult to
describe examples of such fields besides the field of complex numbers,
but rest assured they do exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some researchers drop the first assumptions, and do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_representation_theory">modular
representation theory</a>. One of the problems that arise in this case
is that not all representations decompose as the sum of irreducible
ones. Instead, representations can combine in stranger ways.</p>
<p>My research is about keeping the first assumption, but dropping the
assumption of algebraic closure. This means that I look at fields such
as the rationals or the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic
numbers, and try to inspect the representation theory over them.
Sometimes there is no difference when we look at these fields. For
example, the symmetric groups have no change at all in these
circumstances. The smallest example of a group where there <em>is</em> a
change is the quaternion group <span class="math inline">\(Q_8\)</span>.
It's working out which groups behave differently, and how <em>much</em>
differently, that turns out to be the hard part.</p>
<h2>For the Researcher</h2>
<p>I'm interested in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869308001609">Turull's
Conjecture</a>, which is a McKay-style conjecture in the representation
theory of finite groups. Alexandre Turull proposed this in 2008
following a wealth of work in calculating certain character-theoretic
invariants in a large number of groups.</p>
<p>The McKay conjecture (rhymes with 'McFly') is a fundamental question
in the representation theory of finite groups, positing a bijection
between characters of a group of degree coprime to a prime <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and similar characters of the
normaliser of a Sylow <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-subgroup.
We usually write this as there being a bijection between the sets <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Irr}_{p'}(G)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Irr}_{p'}(N_G(P))\)</span>, for
a given finite group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and Sylow
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-subgroup <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</p>
<p>Following a reduction to the finite simple groups, and the work of
many researchers, the McKay conjecture has been proven – although the
proof involves unpublished work at the time of writing. It also bears
mentioning that no reduction theorem for Turull's conjecture has been
published at time of writing, but <a href="https://heilbronn.ac.uk/2024/04/11/focused-research-on-turulls-conjecture/">work
is being done</a> regarding it.</p>
<p>Turull's conjecture expects the McKay bijection not only to exist,
but also to preserve a certain invariant.</p>
<p>Asking for the McKay bijection to preserve some invariant is not an
entirely new concept. In 2004, Gabriel Navarro suggested <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2004/160-3/p07">a similar
refinement</a> stating that the McKay bijection should preserve the
field of values generated by the character, over the local field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Q_p\)</span>. Some call this the
Galois–McKay conjecture, but more often it is given Navarro's name. A
reduction theorem for this conjecture <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11719">has been proven</a>.</p>
<p>Turull's conjecture adds an extra requirement to what Navarro
suggested the bijection should preserve, namely the Schur index over the
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adics.</p>
<p>So, what is the Schur index? It is a perhaps unsurprising but
somewhat subtle fact that even if a character takes values in a certain
field (for example the real numbers) this does not mean that there is a
representation over that same field which realises that character. Put
as briefly as possible, the Schur index measures the failure of a
character to be realised over a field generated by its character
values.</p>
<p>I am interested in calculating Schur indices for groups of Lie type,
but also more generally trying to find ways to demonstrate equality of
Schur indices of characters of different groups, in the hopes that we
can try and prove Turull right.</p>
