        <p><a href="../">My name is Anton</a>, and I do research in
mathematics.</p>
<p>Here I explain my research interests at three levels: First the
layperson who knows nothing about research mathematics, then the
undergraduate who maybe knows a few fundamental ideas, and then the
researcher who wants to know more of the details.</p>
<h2>For the Layperson</h2>
<p>Mathematicians care a lot about symmetry. Partially because it is
useful, but also because it is beautiful. We can use the symmetry of
certain situations – perhaps of a geometric figure, or of something more
abstract – to reduce complicated questions to much simpler ones. So how
do we study symmetry mathematically? Fortunately mathematicians have
devised a kind of mathematical object which describes a collection of
symmetries, which is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">group</a>. The
study of these so-called groups is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory">group theory</a>.
Don't let this very generic name fool you – these are complicated and
subtle objects which form an important field of study.</p>
<p>A fundamental question mathematicians would like to answer is this:
<em>what are all the ways in which something can be symmetrical?</em>
Another (nearly identical) way of phrasing this is: <em>what are all the
possible groups?</em> Unfortunately, this question seems to be
completely impossible to answer in any satisfying way.</p>
<p>Groups are simply too <em>complicated,</em> in a word. Perhaps this
is a surprising fact, since symmetry seems so nice!</p>
<p>Since classifying all groups is impossible, mathematicians in the mid
20th century instead began trying to classify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_group">finite simple
groups</a>, which (despite their name) are actually quite complicated!
These are the groups which are, in a precise but subtle sense, the
building blocks of all groups. Fortunately, rather than being
impossible, it turned out to be only <em>nearly</em> impossible to
classify the finite simple groups.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, the herculean effort of classifying the simple
groups was completed, forming what is (in my opinion) the greatest
mathematical achievement of humankind so far.</p>
<p>One of the major ideas used in this enormous project was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory">representation
theory</a>. This is a set of tools that we can use to study finite
groups by interpreting a group as a collection of symmetries of space –
often in dimensions much higher than three – called a representation.
Representation theory is so powerful that mathematicians had found a way
to understand the representations of a group called the monster group
before we even knew that it even existed!</p>
<p>My research is about representation theory. I study special groups
that were very important in the classification of finite simple groups,
because if we can answer certain questions about them, then we can
answer questions about the representation theory of <em>all</em> finite
groups. The hope is that this helps us understand how symmetry works in
a deeper way.</p>
<h2>For the Undergraduate</h2>
<p>A representation of a group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>
can be thought of as a map <span class="math inline">\(\rho \colon G \to
M_{n\times n}(\mathbb C)\)</span> where we require <span class="math inline">\(\rho(g)\)</span> to always be an invertible
matrix, and <span class="math inline">\(\rho(gh) =
\rho(g)\rho(h)\)</span>. Not a very interesting definition, I know.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> interesting is there is a notion of a <em>sum</em>
of representations, which we can use to study their structure more
generally.</p>
<p>If we can get a representation to consist of block diagonal matrices
of consistent sizes (after possibly changing basis), we can split up a
representation <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> as the sum
<span class="math inline">\(\rho = \rho_1 \oplus \rho_2\)</span> of
smaller representations – of smaller dimension, I mean. Naturally, there
are representations that cannot be split up any further, and these are
called the <em>irreducible</em> representations, or <em>irreps</em> for
short.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, there is a lot of very nice theory about
irreducible representations, and in any case they allow us to build all
other representations.</p>
<p>If we have a complete list of them for a certain group – up to an
appropriate notion of representations being the same – then we can
actually read a lot of information about the group just by looking at
the representations. Chemists use the information about the
representations of particular groups corresponding to symmetries of
certain molecules in order to calculate various useful things about said
molecules. Of course, mathematicians are interested in representations
for broader reasons.</p>
<p>So what do <em>I</em> do with these things anyway?</p>
<p>This all works very well over the field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb C\)</span> of complex numbers, but if we
look at a smaller field – such as the rationals <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Q\)</span> or the reals <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R\)</span> – then while the theory is
still very nice, we don't get the same wealth of results. You can think
of this as being because these smaller fields mean that some matrices
have eigenvalues that don't occur in the smaller field. My research is
all about this situation where the field isn't <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb C\)</span>, especially when the field is
the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic numbers.</p>
<h2>For the Researcher</h2>
<p>I'm interested in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869308001609">Turull's
Conjecture</a>, which is a McKay-style conjecture in the representation
theory of finite groups. Alexandre Turull proposed this in 2008
following a wealth of work in calculating certain character-theoretic
invariants in a large number of groups.</p>
<p>So what's this conjecture all about, given that I'm betting on it
being correct?</p>
<p>The McKay conjecture is a fundamental question in the representation
theory of finite groups, positing a bijection between characters of a
group of degree coprime to a prime <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and similar characters of the
normaliser of a Sylow <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-subgroup.
We usually write this as there being a bijection between the sets <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Irr}_{p'}(G)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Irr}_{p'}(N_G(P))\)</span>, for
a given finite group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and Sylow
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-subgroup <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Following a reduction to the finite
simple groups, and the work of many researchers, this conjecture has
been proven – although this involves unpublished work at the time of
writing.</p>
<p>Turull's conjecture expects the bijection not only to exist, but also
to preserve a certain invariant.</p>
<p>Asking for the McKay bijection to preserve some invariant is not an
entirely new concept. In 2004, Gabriel Navarro suggested <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2004/160-3/p07">a similar
refinement</a> stating that the McKay bijection should preserve the
field of values generated by the character, over the local field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Q_p\)</span>. Some call this the
Galois–McKay conjecture, but more often it is given Navarro's name.</p>
<p>Turull's conjecture adds an extra layer to what Navarro suggested the
bijection should preserve, namely the element of the Brauer group. The
Brauer element is a somewhat complicated idea, but we can simplify to
the notion of a Schur index, unfortunately losing a bit of
information.</p>
<p>So, what is the Schur index? It is a perhaps unsurprising but
somewhat subtle fact that even if a character takes values in a certain
field (for example the real numbers) this does not mean that there is a
representation over that same field which realises that character. Put
as briefly as possible, the Schur index measures the failure of a
character to be realised over a field generated by its character
values.</p>
<p>Calculating Schur indices is quite difficult in general, although we
do have a handful of effective methods and tricks.</p>
<p>I am interested in calculating Schur indices for groups of Lie type,
but also more generally trying to find ways to demonstrate equality of
Schur indices of characters of different groups, in the hopes that we
can try and prove Turull right.</p>
